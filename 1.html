Hey Jude don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart

Hey Jude don't make it bad Take a sad song and make it better Remember to let her into your heart Then you can start to make it better Hey Jude don't be afraid You were made to go out and get her The minute you let her under your skin Then you begin to make it better And any time you feel the pain Hey Jude refrain Don't carry the world upon your shoulder For well you know that it's a fool Who plays it cool By making his world a little colder Na na na naa-naa na-na-naa naaa Hey Jude don't let me down You have found her now go and get her Let it out and let it in
